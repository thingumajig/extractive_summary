The history was certainly there, and is weighing on the President. But it did not appear anyone felt rebuked at the White House. Minutes before the party-line vote was called, the man joining Trump at the center of the scandal -- his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani -- was seen ambling across the White House driveway toward the West Wing. \\\"Maybe he's here to go to the Christmas party with his son, who works at the White House,\\\" offered Kellyanne Conway, the President's counselor, when asked about Giuliani's presence. The party, according to the White House schedule, was set to begin at 8:15 p.m., a full 10-and-a-half hours after Giuliani arrived.\" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n"
